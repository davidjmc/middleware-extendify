# AquaMOM

AquaMOM is an adaptive IoT middleware support for water monitoring in extreme environments.

In practice, AquaMOM is a platform that supports a holistic IoT solution for monitoring water in remote and economically disadvantaged areas. Its goal is to assist users (e.g., consumers) in improving water conservation efforts in such demanding settings. AquaMOM integrates a low-cost IoT device, a distributed web application and a (self-)adaptive middleware framework to enable a monitoring, analysis, and adaptation loop within the system.
